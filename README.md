# Predicting-Fetal-Health
This project focuses on predicting the health status of unborn babies by analyzing data collected from fetal heart rate monitoring tests (called Cardiotocogram or CTG exams).
Essentially, the project aims to automatically classify fetal health into three categories normal, suspect, or pathological using computer models. Think of it as a tool that helps doctors quickly understand whether a fetus is healthy or if there might be concerns that need further attention.

Objective:
The main goal of this project is to develop reliable machine learning models that can accurately classify fetal health. By doing so, the project aims to support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, leading to better care for both mothers and their unborn children.

Who Benefits from This Project?
  Doctors and Healthcare Professionals:
  They can use the predictions to quickly assess fetal health and make more informed decisions, potentially leading to improved prenatal care.
  
  Healthcare Researchers:
  The project provides a data-driven approach to studying fetal health, which can be further refined and adapted for broader medical research.
  
  Data Scientists in Healthcare:
  Those working on similar projects can learn from the methodology and apply similar techniques to other health-related challenges.

Outcome and Impact of the Project:
  Before applying data science techniques, evaluating fetal health relied heavily on manual interpretation, which could be subjective and time-consuming. With this project:
  
  Enhanced Decision-Making:
  Doctors receive objective, data-based predictions that support their diagnoses and help to quickly identify potential issues.
  
  Improved Accuracy:
  The use of machine learning models leads to more consistent and reliable predictions compared to traditional methods.
  
  Standardization:
  By automating the classification process, the approach standardizes how fetal health is evaluated, reducing variability between different practitioners.
